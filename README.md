# React Router Practice Project

Through this project, I practiced how to define routes, switch between components without reloading the page, and manage navigation both manually and programmatically using hooks like 'useNavigate'. Each page in the app is designed to simulate a real-world use case where different views are rendered based on the URL path.

This project helped me solidify core routing concepts such as nested routes and navigation styling using 'NavLink'. I also experimented with redirecting users to different routes programmatically, which is useful for form submissions or custom logic.

It's a beginner-friendly project, made specifically for understanding routing flow in React applications.
